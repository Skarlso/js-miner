Miner is a CLI utility to manage multiple Minecraft servers with simple commands and Docker Containers to keep them isolated.

Further more it provides the ability to backup any world to a configured S3 bucket.

Simple commands are `attach`, `create`, `start`, `stop`, `backup`.

In the works: `list`, `status`.

Also provides versions of Minecraft with `Bukkit` and pre-configured environment through created Docker Images which are
tagged according to the version they provide.

Thus, it's easy to get a server, which uses mods like the ever famous `/home` teleporter
[MyHome](https://mods.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/myhome).
